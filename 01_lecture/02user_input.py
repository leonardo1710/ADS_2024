Input refers to any information a user gives to the program.
Specifically, the Python command input reads in a line of input typed in by the user.
It may also be used to display a message to the user, to prompt for specific input.

The following program reads in the name of the user with the input command.
It then prints it out with the print command:
"""
# name = input("What is your name? ")
# print("Hi there, " + name)

"""
Variables
